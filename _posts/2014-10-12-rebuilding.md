It's been about two months and going to start rebuilding, ramping up work capacity and lifts for the next month or so, until transitioning into a Texas Method program.

Not going to be actively tracking mobility too much, just doing some pre-/post-workout stretching, yoga, foam rolling, et cetera, as needed.

## training

In general, definitely feeling very low work capacity.

* 5g creatine
* 212.4#

### pre-strength
* 2x10x5# shoulder dislocates -- 10/10

### bb back squat
* 5@45#, 4@135#, 3@155#, 2@185#
* 1x5x225# -- 5
* wearing belt, sleeves
* feels great!

### bb spoto press
* 5@45#, 4@95#, 3@115#
* 2x4x135# -- 4/4
* rack/unrack needs work

### bb pendlay row
* 6@135#
* 2x6x150# -- 6/6
* used straps
* form could be stricter

### bb jefferson curl
* 2x10x45# -- 10/10
